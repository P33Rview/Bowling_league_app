The Bowling Analytics app is a data-driven **Streamlit** application that enables users to visualize their performance and statistics from bowling matches across multiple seasons. The data used for the app is currently stored in a local MySQL database, that is yet to be deployed through AWS to allow for a direct connection within the app.

Initial reason behind the creation of this web app was to provide a solution to the limitation of the Power BI dashboard, which was not capable of being easily shared among users. Development of this app addresses this issue by providing a clean, user-friendly interface that can be easily accessed by anyone.

The app also offers a leaderboard feature that ranks users based on their performance. This feature is particularly useful as it allows users to compare their performance against other players in a visually appealing way. Additionally, the app is accessible from any device with an internet connection, making it easy for users to access their data and visualize their performance on the go.
